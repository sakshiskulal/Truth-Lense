## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** installed
- **Git** configured with your GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of **Python**, **Flask/FastAPI**, and **AI/ML concepts**
- Familiarity with **deepfake detection** (helpful but not required)

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deepcheck-ai.git
   cd deepcheck-ai
   ```

2. **Add upstream remote**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/deepcheck-ai.git
   ```

3. **Create virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Install main dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Install development dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

6. **Configure environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your development settings
   ```

7. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   # Should start the development server without errors
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# Or for documentation
git checkout -b docs/improvement-description
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation improvements
- `test/` - Adding or improving tests
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `perf/` - Performance improvements

### 2. Make Your Changes

#### Code Style Guidelines

We follow **PEP 8** standards with some specific conventions:

```python
# Use descriptive variable names
confidence_score = model.predict(image)  # ‚úÖ Good
cs = model.pred(img)  # ‚ùå Avoid

# Add type hints
def analyze_image(image_path: str, threshold: float = 0.5) -> dict:
    """Analyze image for deepfake detection."""
    pass

# Include comprehensive docstrings
def preprocess_video(video_path: str) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Preprocess video file for deepfake analysis.

    Args:
        video_path (str): Path to the video file

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Preprocessed video frames

    Raises:
        ValueError: If video file is invalid or corrupted
    """
    pass
```

#### Code Formatting

We use **Black** for code formatting:

```bash
# Format your code
black app/ tests/

# Check formatting (CI will run this)
black --check app/ tests/
```

#### Import Organization

Use **isort** for import sorting:

```bash
# Sort imports
isort app/ tests/

# Check import sorting
isort --check-only app/ tests/
```

### 3. Testing Your Changes

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

#### Writing New Tests

Add tests for new functionality:

```python
# tests/test_new_feature.py
import pytest
from app.models.image_detector import ImageDetector

class TestImageDetector:
    def test_valid_image_analysis(self):
        """Test image analysis with valid input."""
        detector = ImageDetector()
        result = detector.analyze("tests/fixtures/real_image.jpg")

        assert result['is_deepfake'] is False
        assert 0 <= result['confidence'] <= 1
        assert result['processing_time'] > 0

    def test_invalid_image_path(self):
        """Test handling of invalid image path."""
        detector = ImageDetector()

        with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
            detector.analyze("nonexistent_file.jpg")
```

### 4. Documentation

#### Code Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Include type hints for parameters and return values
- Document any complex algorithms or business logic
- Add inline comments for non-obvious code sections

#### API Documentation

Update API documentation when adding new endpoints:

```python
@app.route('/api/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze_media():
    """
    Analyze uploaded media for deepfake detection.

    ---
    consumes:
      - multipart/form-data
    parameters:
      - name: file
        in: formData
        type: file
        required: true
        description: Media file to analyze
      - name: threshold
        in: formData
        type: number
        required: false

        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            is_deepfake:
              type: boolean
            confidence:
              type: number
    """
    pass
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Use appropriate data types
import numpy as np

# Efficient image processing
def preprocess_image_batch(images: List[np.ndarray]) -> np.ndarray:
    """Process multiple images efficiently."""
    # Vectorized operations are faster
    batch = np.stack(images)
    return (batch / 255.0).astype(np.float32)

# Memory management
def analyze_large_video(video_path: str) -> dict:
    """Analyze video with memory efficiency."""
    # Process in chunks to avoid memory issues
    chunk_size = 32
    # Implementation details...
```

### Error Handling Best Practices

```python
import logging
from typing import Optional

def safe_model_inference(image_data: np.ndarray) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Perform model inference with proper error handling."""
    try:
        result = model.predict(image_data)
        return {
            'success': True,
            'confidence': float(result.confidence),
            'is_deepfake': bool(result.prediction)
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Model inference failed: {str(e)}")
        return None
```

### Configuration Management

```python
# config/settings.py
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseSettings, Field

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    """Application settings with validation."""

    # Server settings
    host: str = Field(default="0.0.0.0", env="HOST")
    port: int = Field(default=5000, env="PORT")
    debug: bool = Field(default=False, env="DEBUG")

    # Model settings
    model_path: str = Field(..., env="MODEL_PATH")  # Required
    confidence_threshold: float = Field(default=0.5, ge=0.0, le=1.0)

    # File processing
    max_file_size: int = Field(default=100 * 1024 * 1024)  # 100MB
    supported_formats: List[str] = ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "mp4", "wav"]

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        case_sensitive = False
```

### Common Issues

**Q: My tests are failing locally but pass on CI**
A: Ensure you're using the same Python version and dependencies as CI. Check the GitHub Actions configuration.

**Q: How do I add a new detection model?**
A: Create a new model class inheriting from `BaseDetector`, implement required methods, and add tests. See existing models for examples.
