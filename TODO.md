   - Show JWT authentication

3. **File Upload** (2 minutes)
   - Upload sample image/video
   - Show real-time analysis
   - Display trust score and verdict

4. **Azure Integration** (1 minute)
   - Enable Azure services
   - Show enhanced analysis
   - Compare with/without Azure

5. **Blockchain Verification** (1 minute)
   - Show on-chain transaction
   - View transaction on Polygonscan
   - Explain immutability benefits

### Demo Files to Prepare
- [ ] Sample deepfake image

## Development Notes

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Required for basic functionality
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:pass@host:port/db

# Required for blockchain
